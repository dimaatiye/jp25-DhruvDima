Modules: 2D Gameplay Programming, 3D Gameplay Programming, and Software Engineering

Summary: In "Maze of Shadows", the player navigates a maze in complete darkness, only able to see within a limited radius. The game starts with an initial 5 seconds of visibility, after which the lights turn off, and the player must rely on spatial partitioning to find their way to the end point. The player must also avoid detection by a pursuing enemy that has a vision cone and can shoot at the player if alerted. The enemy can detect the player based on proximity or sound, and it will chase and shoot if the player enters its range. The player must use their wits to move through the maze, avoid the enemy, and survive to reach the goal.

This game incorporates core gameplay programming techniques, including movement, AI behavior (enemy detection and pursuit), lighting mechanics, and environmental interactions, offering a challenge in both 2D and 3D environments. The game also emphasizes strong software engineering principles, with a focus on modular design and code maintainability.
